OCR app for video games — capture game windows, run OCR (EasyOCR), and translate text.

Game-OCR lets you capture text directly from PC game windows.  
It supports **Japanese + English OCR** using [EasyOCR](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR) and integrates with **DeepL** for automatic translation.
Built with **PySide6** for the GUI, it’s designed to help players understand menus, dialogues, and HUD elements in games that don’t have English localization.


## Disclaimer

This project is **experimental** and currently in **beta**.  
It is not a full-fledged app — expect bugs, missing features, and breaking changes.  

Use at your own risk, and please report issues if you try it out!

## Features
- Simple PySide6 GUI with screenshot, refresh, OCR, and API settings
- EasyOCR with GPU acceleration
- DeepL integration
- Captures any window including games
- Works for full screen, borderless, and windowed modes

## Note
- Currently, you must compile the dll file needed to run the OCR. In the future, the dll will be packaged into an exe
- Visual Studio files included so you can build you own DLL if desired.
- You must **grab a screen at least once** before OCR is enabled.
- You must get at DeepL API key (free) in order to perform translation.
- Image will appear low quality if viewed on a monitor with higher resolutions than the game window's monitor

## Requirements
- tested on python **3.11.5**
- (Optional) Visual Studio 2022 with **Desktop Development with C++** workload to build DLL files
